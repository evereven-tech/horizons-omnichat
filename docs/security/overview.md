# Security Overview

## Introduction

Horizons OmniChat is designed with security-first principles across all deployment modes. This overview provides a comprehensive look at our security architecture and practices.

## Security Architecture Layers

### 1. Application Security

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication (AWS Mode)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management
- JWT token validation
- API key authentication

#### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption
- Data at rest encryption
- Secure secret management
- Input/Output validation

### 2. Network Security

#### Infrastructure Protection

    C --> D[Private Subnet]
    D --> E[Container Services]
    E --> F[Encrypted Storage]
```

#### Security Controls
- TLS 1.3 encryption
- Network segmentation
- Security groups
- NACLs
- Private subnets
- VPC endpoints

### 3. Operational Security

#### Access Management
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Secure credential rotation
- Audit logging

#### Monitoring & Response
- Real-time security monitoring
- Incident response procedures
- Automated alerts
- Security event logging

## Deployment Mode Security Features

### Local Mode
- Basic authentication
- Local network isolation
- File system encryption
- Secure configuration storage

### Hybrid Mode
All Local Mode features plus:
- AWS IAM integration

- AWS CloudTrail auditing

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Access Control
```yaml
Principles:
  - Least privilege access
  - Role-based permissions
  - Regular access reviews
  - Strong password policies
  - Session management
```

### 2. Data Security
```yaml
Measures:
  - Encryption at rest
  - Encryption in transit
  - Secure key management
  - Data classification
  - Retention policies
```

### 3. Network Security
```yaml
Controls:
  - Network segmentation
  - Firewall rules
  - TLS encryption
  - VPC isolation
  - Security groups
```

## Compliance & Standards

### Supported Frameworks
- GDPR compliance features
- HIPAA readiness (Enterprise)
- SOC 2 controls (Enterprise)
- ISO 27001 alignment

### Security Certifications
- AWS Security Best Practices
- Container Security Standards
- API Security Guidelines

## Security Features Matrix
